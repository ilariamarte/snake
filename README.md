# snake
Simple pixelated Snake-like game  

One of my first Python programs, created to learn and practice the Python language  
I recommend to anyone who'd like to learn a new coding language to start with an easy project like this one  
You can use it to learn basic class usage and how to create a GUI within the pygame library workspace  
It may not have the best syntax, since I wasn't so acquainted with Python at the time, but it's a start  
Enjoy!  

## How to play
Move the "snake" around to eat the "fruits" and get progressively longer  
If you collide with the game area borders or with yourself you lose  
Fill the game area to win  

## Commands
Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the game window  
Use the P key to pause the game  
If you die (snake becomes blue and the game stops) you can respawn using the Space key
